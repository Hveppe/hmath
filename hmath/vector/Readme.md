# Vector
This module is part of the hmath library and provides essential classes for working with 2D and 3D vectors, along with related utility functions.

## Key Features
Key features of the module is:
- Custom operator overloads for vector classes (+, -, *)
- Utility functions such as length, unit vector creation, angle between vectors, and more.
- The ablity to convert 2D vector between polar and cartesian forms.

## Integration Example
The module can be used either by including the entire library or by directly including vector.h, as shown below.
``` c++
#include "hmath/vector/vector.h"
```

It is also possible to include only vector2.h or vector3.h if you only need 2D or 3D vectors.
